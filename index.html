	<p> Come and listen to my story about a man named Jed 
			A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed, 
			And then one day he was shootin at some food, 
			And up through the ground come a bubblin crude. 

			Oil that is,
			black gold, Texas tea. 

			Well the first thing you know ol Jed's a millionaire, 
			The kinfolk said "Jed move away from there" 
			Said "Californy is the place you ought to be" 
			So they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly 

			Hills, that is. Swimmin pools, movie stars. 

			The Beverly Hillbillies
